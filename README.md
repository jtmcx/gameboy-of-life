# Gameboy of Life

This is a (work in progress) implementation of [Conway's Game of Life][1]
for the gameboy.

I honestly am not sure the status of this project. I started it around
2019 while attending the Recurse Center, but I abandoned it for some
reason. It's been collecting dust in my home folder for years, and I
didn't comment as much as I should have, so it's hard to decipher. But
maybe one day I'll pick it back up! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
